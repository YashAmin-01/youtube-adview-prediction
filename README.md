# youtube-adview-prediction

In this project there are two datasets named "train.csv" and "test.csv"

The datasets are cleaned and observations were made by visualising the dataset 

Different machine learning models were trained using the "train.csv" dataset and the best model was chosen to predict the adviews for a video baased on the different 
parameters of a video.

Predictions for the adviews are made for the "test.csv" dataset and the predictions are stored in a seperate csv file
